1.Project Overview
This application allows users to register and log in to a student management portal. Once authenticated, users can view all student records, edit existing entries, and delete records through an interactive modal-based interface. The backend uses Hibernate ORM to handle all database interactions with a PostgreSQL database, eliminating the need for raw SQL queries in the application code.

2.Technologies Used
Java 8 or above Apache Tomcat 9 (Servlet Container) Hibernate ORM 5.3.7 PostgreSQL 42.6.0 Driver Java Servlet API 3.1 JAXB API 2.3.1 Maven (Build Tool) JSP (JavaServer Pages) for front-end rendering HTML and CSS for UI styling

3.Project Structure
The project follows a standard Maven web application layout as seen in Eclipse IDE.

4.Features
User Registration with name, email, phone number, course, college name, and password

User Login with session management

Home Dashboard that lists all registered students in a table

Edit Student Record using a modal popup form

Delete Student Record using a confirmation modal

Session-based authentication to protect the home page

Hibernate auto DDL (update mode) to auto-create or update the database table

5.Database Configuration
The database connection is configured in the file:

src/main/resources/hibernate.cfg.xml
The current configuration connects to a local PostgreSQL instance using these settings:

Driver       : org.postgresql.Driver
URL          : jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres
Username     : postgres
Password     : (your password here)
Dialect      : org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
DDL Mode     : update (auto creates or updates tables)
Show SQL     : true (prints queries in console)
To switch to a different database such as MySQL, update the driver class, connection URL, and dialect accordingly in the same configuration file and add the appropriate Maven dependency in pom.xml.

6.How to Run
Step 1 - Clone or download this project to your local machine.

Step 2 - Make sure PostgreSQL is running and a database is available. Update the username and password in hibernate.cfg.xml to match your local credentials.

Step 3 - Open the project in Eclipse IDE (or any IDE with Maven and Tomcat support).

Step 4 - Right-click the project and select Maven, then Update Project to download all dependencies.

Step 5 - Deploy the project on Apache Tomcat 9.

Step 6 - Open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:8080/MyHibernateProj/login
Step 7 - Register a new account and then log in to access the student management dashboard.

7.Application Flow
The user visits the login page at the /login endpoint.

If the user does not have an account, they navigate to /register and fill in their details.

On successful registration, the data is saved to the PostgreSQL database via Hibernate and the user is redirected to the login page.

After a successful login, a session is created and the user is redirected to /home.

The home page fetches all student records from the database and displays them in a table.

The user can click Edit on any row to open a modal with pre-filled data, make changes, and submit the update.

The user can click Delete on any row to open a confirmation modal and confirm the deletion.

After any edit or delete operation, the user is redirected back to the home page with refreshed data.

8.API Endpoints
GET  /login       Renders the login form
POST /login       Validates credentials and creates a session

GET  /register    Renders the registration form
POST /register    Saves new student data to the database

GET  /home        Fetches all students and displays the home dashboard

POST /Edit        Updates an existing student record by ID

POST /delete      Deletes an existing student record by ID
Known Issues and Notes
Passwords are currently stored in plain text. It is strongly recommended to implement password hashing using BCrypt or a similar library before deploying this application in any production or public environment.

The application uses scriptlets inside JSP files. For cleaner and more maintainable code, consider migrating to JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag Library) in future versions.

The edit form field name for college name in the servlet is "collegename" while the original registration uses "college_name". Ensure these are consistent if you encounter update issues.

Sessions are not explicitly invalidated on logout. Adding session.invalidate() in the logout handler is recommended to improve security.
